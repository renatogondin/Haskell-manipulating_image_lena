# Haskell-manipulating_image_lena

This is a simple project where you pick a simple ppm image full of pixels and create some new images.
You pick a Lena.ppm image and manipulate the pixels having different shapes, colours and inverting.



first, I'd like you to read this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna

I am also attaching 3 other images:

Lena's image in ppm format, the manipulations the Haskell code will do after working with the pixels 
ans some instructions with flags where you can invert the pixels.
